# Classification_Project
Mod3 Classification Project using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water

by Antonio Hila and Jude Buenaseda

This project aims to predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all as part of the Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table Competition by Drivendata (www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/) 


## Project Overview
For this project we are looking at data on water wells in Tanzania. We want to see what factors of the well (location, altitude, quantity and quality of water, etc) lead to lack of functionality of wells. This information could then be used by the companies that handle the functionality of the well (whether it be the government or the other companies) to decide what wells that are functional now may be showing signs of wear and will need to be replaced soon.

The approach we took on this was to first look at this problem as a logical one and use preset ideas we had about wells and what could lead to damage to make a base model. From there we used different methods of Data analysis to get a better idea of what exactly we want to look at.
